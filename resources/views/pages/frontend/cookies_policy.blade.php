               <p>We at REA Group Ltd, our affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively, referred to as “REA”, “we”, “our” or “us” in this policy) respect your privacy.</p>

               <p>We collect information by automated means when you visit, access, or use our desktop and mobile websites, mobile, tablet and smartwatch apps, electronic newsletters and widgets (collectively, “Sites”). We have a dedicated section below which explains how our iOS apps use cookies in accordance with Apple's App Tracking Transparency requirements.  Our Sites include:</p>


               <ul>
                <li> <a>Country/Region</a></li>
                <li><a>Site</a></li>

               <p>We collect information through Cookies and other tracking technologies including web beacons, pixels, JavaScript and web server logs. This Cookie Policy explains how we use Cookies and similar technologies and how you can control them. We may update this Cookie Policy periodically. Please take a look at the Effective Date at the bottom of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised.</p>

               <p>
Our use of Cookies and similar technologies may involve the processing of Personal Information (i.e., any information relating to an identified or identifiable individual).  For more information on our data protection practices, see our Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>For Apple iOS App users</p>

<p>Our Apple iOS Apps have been tailored to meet Apple’s App Tracking Transparency requirements. Unlike our other Sites, our iOS Apps do not track our iOS users for the purposes of personalised or targeted advertising. In particular, this means that our iOS Apps do not link user or device data collected from our iOS Apps with user or device data collected from third party apps, websites or offline properties for targeted advertising or advertising measurement purposes. User and device data from our iOS Apps is not shared with data brokers. Other than the iOS App-specific cookie restrictions and limitations set out in this paragraph, this Cookie Policy summarises how our iOS Apps obtain and use cookies.</p>


<ol>
 
<li>
    <p>WHAT ARE COOKIES, WEB BEACONS AND PIXELS?</p>
    <p>A “Cookie” is a small text file that a website sends to your computer, tablet or mobile phone to uniquely identify or store information in your browser.</p>
    <p>“Web beacons” and tracking “pixels” are bits of data that count the number of users who access a website and track how they use the website. Web beacons used on our Sites or in emails allow us to see how successful an article has been, or whether an email message was successfully delivered and read in a marketing campaign. Web beacons are also used to verify any clicks through to links or ads contained in emails. We may use this information to help us identify which emails are more interesting to you and to inform advertisers how many people have clicked on their ads.</p>
    <p>“Tracking URLs” are special links that allow us to measure when a link is clicked on. They are used to help us measure the effectiveness of campaigns and advertising and the popularity of content that is read.</p>
   
</li>
<li>
<p>WHAT INFORMATION DO WE OBTAIN THROUGH COOKIES?</p>
    <p>The information we obtain through Cookies and similar technologies may include your IP address, mobile device advertising ID, browser characteristics, device characteristics, unique device ID, operating system, language preferences, referring URLs, logs on actions taken on our Sites such as content on which you may click while browsing the Sites, and dates and times you access or use the Sites. In connection with our mobile and tablet apps, we may use similar automated means.</p>
 
</li>
<li>
<p>FOR WHAT PURPOSES DO WE USE COOKIES?</p>
    <p>Our Sites use Cookies and similar technologies to function effectively.  For example, Cookies can recognise you and remember important information that will make your use of our Sites more convenient, such as by remembering your preferences.  The information we obtain through Cookies will tell us, for example, if you have used our Sites before, from what country and what content you have visited. It will also tell us whether you have opened an email we sent to you, what search queries you may have run and what advertisements you may have seen on our Sites.  In addition, Cookies allow us to display relevant content, provide advertising and enhance your online experience. </p>
    <p>We may also use Cookies to link your use of the Sites to Personal Information we have about you.  For example, if you have searched our Sites for new apartments in the CBD, Cookies will enable us to show you other new apartments in nearby suburbs, rather than showing you property types and locations that may be of less interest to you.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>WHAT COOKIES DO WE USE?</p>

<p>Our Sites implement different types of Cookies, including:</p>
<p>First-party Cookies: These are Cookies that we place on your device when you visit our Sites.
Third-party Cookies: These are Cookies that are set by a website other than ours when you visit our Sites. 
Persistent Cookies: These Cookies remain on your computer or mobile device for the period of time specified in the Cookie. They are activated each time that you visit the Site that created that particular Cookie and may remain on your device following the end of your browsing session.</p>
<p>Session Cookies: Session Cookies are created temporarily. These Cookies allow us to link your actions during your browser session on our Sites. A browser session starts when you open the browser window and finishes when you close the browser window. Once you close the browser, all session Cookies are deleted.
Below we describe the purposes for which we use Cookies on our Sites.</p>
<p>
Strictly Necessary Cookies.
These Cookies are essential to the Sites in order to facilitate our authentication, sign-up or log-in process and enable you to surf on a Site or use its features. Without these Cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of our services or features, and the Sites will not perform as smoothly for you as we would like. Strictly Necessary Cookies on our Sites may collect encrypted user session identifiers, device identifiers, demographic information, log-in identifiers and information necessary to authenticate users on multiple Sites.  These Cookies are mostly Session Cookies that are deleted after each browser session.</p>
<p>
Functionality Cookies.
In some circumstances, we may use functionality Cookies to allow us to remember the choices you make while browsing the Sites, to provide enhanced and more personalised content and features (such as customising a certain webpage, remembering your preferred language or remembering your username) and for other services you request, like watching a video or commenting on a blog.</p>
<p>In order to permit your connection to our Sites, our servers receive and record information about your computer, device, and browser, potentially including your IP address, browser type, and other software or hardware information. If you access the Sites from a mobile or other device, we may collect a unique device identifier assigned to that device (“REAUID”), geolocation data, or other traffic information for that device.</p>
<p>Functionality Cookies help us, for example, improve your visit to the Sites, use credentials to automatically login a user, determine the approximate device location during a session, count articles viewed or store selected language settings.</p>

<p>
Analytics Cookies.
We and our service providers may use analytics to collect information about your use of the Sites to help create reports and statistics on the performance of the Site and to present you with content tailored to your interests. Analytics collect information such as your IP address, type of device, operating system, referring URLs, country information, date and time of page visits, and which pages you visit the most. The information allows us to count our audience size, see the overall patterns of usage on the Sites, help us record any difficulties you have with the Sites and show us whether our advertising is effective or not. Information collected via the use of analytics will be de-identified, when it is no longer required for a legitimate business interest. Analytics on our Sites may include:</p>

<p>Targeting and Advertising Cookies.
We use Targeting and Advertising Cookies to provide ads that are more relevant to your interests. This can be done by delivering online ads based on your previous web browsing activity, known as “online behavioural advertising”. Cookies are placed on your browser which will remember the websites you have visited. Advertising based on what you have been looking at is then displayed to you when you visit websites who use the same advertising networks.  For example, if you look at a new three bedroom house on our Site, Targeting and Advertising Cookies may be used to show you ads for that house on social media platforms or third party websites.  These Cookies may be combined with other information acquired from third parties.  We may share this information with other organisations in accordance with applicable laws.  We may also target you with ads based on your geographic location (determined by your IP address). </p>
<p>For more information about Targeting and Advertising Cookies and how you can opt out, visit:</p>

<br>
<a href="http://optout.networkadvertising.org/">http://optout.networkadvertising.org/</a>

<p>If you opt out of Targeting and Advertising Cookies, you will still see ads on our Sites, however, REA will not individually tailor the ads you see, based on your online behaviour.  You may still receive targeted ads from other third party websites or social media platforms, where you have not opted out on those websites.</p>
<p>Social Networking Cookies.
Our products may have social plug-in capabilities which may include Cookies used to allow you to register to our Sites with your social network account and to track both members and non-members of social networks for additional purposes such as behavioural advertising, analytics, and market research.</p>

<p>HOW DO THIRD PARTIES USE COOKIES ON THE SITE?</p>
<p>In some circumstances, we may work with third parties to provide services on our Sites. For example, we use analytics services supported by third party companies who generate analytics Cookies on our behalf. We may not have access to these Cookies, although we may use statistical information arising from the Cookies provided by these third parties to customise content and for the other purposes described above. These companies may also transfer this information to other parties where required to do so by law, or where such other parties process the information on their behalf.</p>
<p>Third-party advertisers and other organisations may also use their own Cookies to collect information about your activities on our Sites and/or the advertisements you have clicked on. This information, which may be combined with other information acquired from third parties, may be used by them to serve advertisements on our Sites and third party sites that they believe are most likely to be of interest to you based on content you have viewed.</p>
<p>Third-party advertisers may also use this information to measure the effectiveness of their advertisements and to track aggregate usage statistics.</p>
<p>We may not control these third-party Cookies and their use may be governed by the privacy policies of the third parties employing these Cookies.
