                <li><b>LEGAL DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION AGREEMENT </b>	<u>Please Read This Following Clause Carefully – It May Significantly Affect Your Legal Rights, Including Your Right to File a Lawsuit in Court</u>
            
            <ol start="0">
                <li>	<b>Initial Dispute Resolution.</b> We are available by email at <a href=""> support@OkRoomie.com </a> to address any concerns you may have regarding your use of the Service. Most concerns may be quickly resolved in this manner. Each of you and Ok Roomie agree to use best efforts to settle any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement directly through consultation and good faith negotiations which shall be a precondition to either party initiating a lawsuit or arbitration.</li>
                <li>	<b>Agreement to Binding Arbitration.</b> If we do not reach an agreed upon solution within a period of thirty (30) days from the time informal dispute resolution is pursued pursuant to Section 14(A) above, then either party may initiate binding arbitration. All claims arising out of or relating to these Terms of Use (including their formation, performance and breach), the parties’ relationship with each other and/or your use of the Service shall be finally settled by binding arbitration administered on a confidential basis by JAMS, in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures, excluding any rules or procedures governing or permitting class actions. Each party will have the right to use legal counsel in connection with arbitration at its own expense. The parties shall select a single neutral arbitrator in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve all disputes arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of these Terms of Use, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of these Terms of Use is void or voidable. The arbitrator shall be empowered to grant whatever relief would be available in a court under law or in equity. The arbitrator’s award shall be in writing and provide a statement of the essential findings and conclusions, shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. The interpretation and enforcement of these Terms of Use shall be subject to the Federal Arbitration Act. <b>The JAMS rules governing the arbitration may be accessed at</b> <a href=""> https://www.jamsadr.com/adr-rules-procedures </a> <b>. If you initiate arbitration, to the extent the filing fee for the arbitration exceeds Two Hundred and Fifty U.S. Dollars ($250.00), we will pay the additional cost. If we are required to pay the additional cost of the filing fees, you should submit a request for payment of fees to JAMS along with your form for initiating the arbitration, and we will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to JAMS. We will also be responsible for paying all other arbitration costs arising in connection with the arbitration. You will not be required to pay fees and costs incurred by Ok Roomie if you do not prevail in arbitration. The parties understand that, absent this mandatory provision, they would have the right to sue in court and have a jury trial. They further understand that, in some instances, the costs of arbitration could exceed the costs of litigation and the right to discovery may be more limited in arbitration than in court.</b> </li>
                <li> <b>	Class Action and Class Arbitration Waiver.</b> You and Ok Roomie each further agree that any arbitration shall be conducted in your respective individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and you and Ok Roomie each expressly waive your respective right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth in this paragraph is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the arbitration provision set forth above in Section 14(B) shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.</li>
                <li>	<b>Exception - Small Claims Court Claims.</b> Notwithstanding the parties’ agreement to resolve all disputes through arbitration, either party may seek relief in a small claims court for disputes or claims within the scope of that court’s jurisdiction.</li>
                <li> <b>	30 Day Right to Opt Out. </b> You have the right to opt-out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions set forth in Sections 14(B), 14(C), and 14(D) by sending written notice of your decision to opt-out to the following email: <a href="">help@OkRoomie.com.</a> The notice must be sent within thirty (30) days of registering to use the Service, otherwise you shall be bound to arbitrate disputes in accordance with the terms of those sections. If you opt-out of these arbitration provisions, we also will not be bound by them.</li>
                <li><b>	Exclusive Venue for Litigation.</b> To the extent that the arbitration provisions set forth in Section 14(B) do not apply, of if you want to pursue any legal remedies to which you would otherwise be entitled but that are not available to you pursuant to this Section 14, the parties agree that any litigation between them shall be filed exclusively in state or federal courts located in New York County, New York (except for small claims court actions which may be brought in the county where you reside). The parties expressly consent to exclusive jurisdiction in New York for any litigation other than small claims court actions.</li>

If any provision or part of a provision of these Terms of Use is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or part of the provision is deemed severable from these Terms of Use and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</li> 
<li>	<b>Assignment.</b> We may assign our rights under these Terms of Use without your approval.</li>
<li><b>Entire Agreement. </b>	These Terms of Use constitutes the complete and exclusive understanding and agreement of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior understandings, proposals, agreements, negotiations, and discussions between the parties, whether written or oral.</li>
